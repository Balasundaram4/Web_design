     <h2>About Me</h2>
	 <img src="my.jpg">
     <p>Hi, I’m Balasundaram, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in Java programming, object-oriented design, and data structures. I recently graduated with a B.E. degree, and I’m currently honing my skills further through practical experience, including a successful internship at CodeAlpha, where I worked on real-world projects involving advanced Java techniques. During my internship, I developed efficient solutions for complex tasks, collaborated with a dynamic team, and gained hands-on experience in full-stack development. I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and applying innovative approaches to problem-solving.</p>
<h2>Hobby</h2>
<ul><li>Cricket:</li></ul>
<p>As a cricket enthusiast, you likely enjoy both playing and following the game closely. Cricket not only hones physical endurance but also fosters teamwork, strategic thinking, and leadership skills, particularly when you're part of a team or even leading one. </p>
